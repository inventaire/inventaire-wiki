<!-- LANG:EN, title="Economic model"-->
 
## Context

The web application has now an organized structure registered under the french law (see [association](https://wiki.inventaire.io/wiki/Association)), the statuses of the association describes it as a non-profit with economic activity. We are also two core members working full time (Core Members) on the plateform and would like to continue to do so.  This result in two organizational axes:
- a public interest mission
- an obligation of economic viability

##Â Economic roadmap

Inventaire is a contributive: in a first time, volunteer contribute unpaid because they like the project and share its objectives. They are free to self-assign tasks (contributing to code, design, communication etc). The [trello board](https://trello.com/b/0lKcsZDj/inventaire-roadmap) was created for that purpose.

Although the association was created in June 2019, Inventaire has not made its revenue model clear yet. The objective would be to have the Core Members team paid, and helped by part-time unpaid contributors, following Wikimedia or Mozilla model. Other track to explore: [open value accounting](http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Value_Accounting)

That's the vision, but there is a long way to go and potentially many changes ahead (for instance, if our explorations lead to find a way to make Inventaire work on a fully decentralized architecture, the infrastructure costs would be totally different, and some of the present hypothesis may become irrelevant). All we can say is that if you like Inventaire and want to contribute, you are very welcome to do so, and we will do all we can to help you!

### Clues on the revenue model

- it **won't** be advertising
- it **won't** be selling users personal data
- it might be donations/crowdfunding/free pricing system
- it might be a form of freemium with a premium offer targeting professional users
- it might be grants from large institutions, foundations or non-profits
- it might be taking a commission on sold items
