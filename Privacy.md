This document is making clear and understandable how Inventaire gather information about you and what is done with it. Because here like everywhere on the web, you've got to ask yourself one question : 

## Who owns my data ?

Short answer: only you

Longer answer : 
You can access you user information through your [user page](https://inventaire.io/api/user/)

You can automatically remove your account which also removes your inventaire of books. Notice that Inventaire keep your username and your email in case you want to reopen an account (this feature is legacy and will be deleted in the future).

We will never sell your data to anyone. Like you, we are readers and we know how your books can precisely describe yourself. We even integrated this non selling policy into the [association status](Association) [in french].

## Information about you
When you use the application, Inventaire might collect :

- Basic profile information such as name, email, language, picture
- Geolocation is only possible in the [user settings page](https://inventaire.io/settings/profile) as an approximative geo point
- Messages in [transations](https://inventaire.io/transactions) from and to other members
- Information on your inventory: public and private comments

## Analytics
We use [Matomo](https://matomo.org) (ex-Piwik) to have some vanity metrics which gather information such as IP adress, location, browser details. This service is hosted by [allmende.io](allmende.io)

## GDPR
Our servers are located in the European Union, and then falls under the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).
