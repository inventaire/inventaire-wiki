<!-- LANG:EN, title="How to contribute"-->

## For everyone
 
 * look for cards on the [roadmap board](https://trello.com/b/0lKcsZDj/inventaire-roadmap) with the tag **Doable by new contributors** (pink tag):
  * [take a great picture with books to renew the homepage background](https://trello.com/c/Ny3dfpkJ/97-take-a-great-picture-with-books-to-renew-the-homepage-background)
  * [write or translate tutorials on how to use the different features](https://wiki.inventaire.io/wiki/Tutorials)
  * [organize a user meeting in your city](https://trello.com/c/EexK1Uve/98-organize-a-user-meeting-in-your-city)

* [**translate** inventaire in a new language](https://www.transifex.com/inventaire/inventaire/)

* **spread the word**!
   * [invite friends to join by email](https://inventaire.io/network/friends)
   * share on social networks
   * help to reach people who might be interested in using it: you know a blog about books or openknowledge, maybe they would be interested in talking about inventaire!

* give **feedback** on what works and what doesn't, either by commenting a card on the [roadmap board](https://trello.com/b/0lKcsZDj/inventaire-roadmap) or by sending an email at hello@inventaire.io 

* help **designing inventaire** by upvoting feature cards on this board, commenting or creating new ones: don't be afraid, you can't break anything (well, unless you aim for it, don't take it as a challenge ;) )

* help to improve the **data** (no technical skills required): find the missing data for [books without author](http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-game/#mode=no_author)

## Technical tasks

* [help with **code on Inventaire**](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/wiki#new-contributors)

* [help with **code on external tools and projects**]( https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/wiki/wishlist)
