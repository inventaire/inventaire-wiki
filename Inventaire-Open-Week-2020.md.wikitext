There will be people there during the whole week, but '''if you can be with us just for a few hours or days, that's totally ok!'''

== Venue ==

'''[https://kanthaus.online/en/ Kanthaus]''' is [https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/99897633 a house in Wurzen, near Leipzig, Germany], '''&quot;''A house for sustainable projects''&quot;'''

=== Address ===

[https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/99897633 Kantstra√üe 20 &amp; 22, Wurzen]

== Getting there ==

==== By train ====

Coming from outside Germany to Wurzen by train can be affordable thank to Deutsch Bahn ''Super Sparpreis Europa'' tickets (ex: [https://www.trainline.eu/search/lyon/wurzen/2020-05-12-06:00 Lyon-Wurzen]).

==== By hitchhicking ====

see [https://hitchwiki.org hitchwiki.org]

==== By car ====

There is plenty of space to park in Wurzen

== Accomodation ==

=== In Kanthaus ===

The house has several '''common sleeping rooms''' and a few private rooms that we will share with the residents that aren't in Summer festivals at that time.

=== In Leipzig ===

Staying in Leipzig is also an option: there are trains connecting Leipzig to Wurzen - line '''S4''', around 2 per hour during the day -, and Kanthaus is very close to the train station... but you would be missing out on the wonders of the life in Kanthaus!

== Food ==

Kanthaus has plenty of food thank to the residents many food saving/sharing skills! Let us know if you have special needs on the day you arrive, so that we can try to accomodate everyone.
