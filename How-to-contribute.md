<!-- LANG:EN, title="How to contribute"-->

For any question on any of those, feel welcome to ask in any of our **[[Communication channels|communication channels]]**!

## For everyone

* help to improve **[[Data|books data]]** (no technical skills required), both:
  * in Inventaire: on any book's page, click the pencil (should be somewhere on the top right) to display the data editor
  * in Wikidata:
      * find the missing data for [books without author](http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-game/#mode=no_author)
 
* look for cards on the [roadmap board](https://trello.com/b/0lKcsZDj/inventaire-roadmap) with the tag **Doable by new contributors** (pink tag):
  * [take a great picture with books to renew the homepage background](https://trello.com/c/Ny3dfpkJ/97-take-a-great-picture-with-books-to-renew-the-homepage-background)
  * [write or translate tutorials on how to use the different features](https://wiki.inventaire.io/wiki/Tutorials)
  * [organize a user meeting in your city](https://trello.com/c/EexK1Uve/98-organize-a-user-meeting-in-your-city)

* **translate** inventaire in a new language or help improving an existing translation: everything is done from our [Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/inventaire/inventaire/). New translations are needed periodically, you are thus invited to [create a time capsule to re-open Transifex once a month](http://maxlath.eu/projects/time-capsule/) to keep your language translation up-to-date.

* **spread the word**!
   * [invite friends to join by email](https://inventaire.io/network/friends)
   * share on social networks
   * help to reach people who might be interested in using it: you know a blog about books or openknowledge, maybe they would be interested in talking about inventaire!

* give **feedback** on what works and what doesn't, either by commenting a card on the [roadmap board](https://trello.com/b/0lKcsZDj/inventaire-roadmap) or by sending an email at hello@inventaire.io 

* help **designing inventaire** by upvoting feature cards on this board, commenting or creating new ones: don't be afraid, you can't break anything (well, unless you aim for it, don't take it as a challenge ;) )
