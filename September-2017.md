## Developments

### Accept Wikimedia project sitelinks as alias URIs
It was already possible to find authors by their twitter name:
* [https://inventaire.io/entity/twitter:NaomiAKlein](https://inventaire.io/entity/twitter:NaomiAKlein)

It is now also possible to find all sorts of entities using the title of one of their page on a Wikimedia project:
* [https://inventaire.io/entity/enwiki:Naomi_Klein](https://inventaire.io/entity/enwiki:Naomi_Klein)
* [https://inventaire.io/entity/eswikiquote:J. K. Rowling](https://inventaire.io/entity/eswikiquote:J. K. Rowling)

### Increasing entity claims constraints
  The webapp was already only suggestion humans as possible authors, series as series, etc, but the server was still accepting claim values without checking the type. That's what was fixed by [bda91ba](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/commit/bda91ba5c3344ba1f8d0a1a0608685f7ec6759a6)
