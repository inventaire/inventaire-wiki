<!-- LANG:EN, title="Social Network Guidelines "-->

== Official Accounts Etiquette ==

You got granted the right to post on social networks in the name of Inventaire: congratulations!

Here are some '''points we agreed on''', recpect them or discuss it [[|here]]:

* help to keep those accounts alive and help to promote our projects by any mean that seems to fit, in line with the project's mission, and the tone used so far
* no insult or use any aggresive forms (even passive)
* do not express any views that may be against views shared by the team: if the need arise prefer using your personal account, possibly underlining that it's only your opinion
* do not express political views with the common accounts, even if concensual among team, at the exception of subjects strongly related to the project's mission (promotion of open knowledge and libre software, and the rights to personal data and privacy)
* feel welcome to retweet/boost/fav/star your personal account tweets/toots if related to the project and following the above rules
