## Developments
### Groups
Following pandark issues ([#121](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/issues/121), [#122](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/issues/122)), groups got a major update:
- [**Group board**](https://inventaire.io/network/groups/settings): 
  - a sub-menu was added to allow inviting to the group by email
  - sub-menus are now wrapped by default for more clarity
- [improved API documentation](https://api.inventaire.io/#/Groups)
