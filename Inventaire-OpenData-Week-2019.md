The house has several common sleeping rooms and a few private rooms that we will share with the residents that aren't in Summer festivals at that time. Staying in Leipzig is also an option: there are S4 trains connecting Leipzig to Wurzen (around 2 per hour during the day), and Kanthaus is very close to the train station... but you would be missing out on the wonders of the life in Kanthaus!
