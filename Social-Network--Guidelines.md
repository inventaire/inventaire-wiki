## Official Accounts Etiquette
You got granted the right to post on social networks in the name of Inventaire: congratulations!
Here are some **do's and don'ts to keep it sane**:
- do help to keep those accounts alive and help to promote our projects by any mean that seems to fit, in line with the project's mission, and the tone used so far
- do not insult, use any aggresive forms (even passive), or express any views that might not be concensual among the team: if the need arise and that you can't get a consensus, use your personal account, possibly underlining that it's only your opinion
- do not express political views with the common accounts, even if concensual among team, at the exception of subjects strongly related to the project's mission (promotion of open knowledge and libre software, and the rights to personal data and privacy)
- feel welcome to retweet/boost/fav/star your personal account tweets/toots if related to the project and following the above rules
